<h1>Quantum Numbers of SHAOWN-001 Atom</h1>

SHAOWN-001 is an atom with the following quantum numbers:

l: Ranges from n to 0

m: Ranges from -(l+1) to +(l+1)

s: 0 or ±1/2

`The goal of this project is to calculate the electron number in the nth shell of SHAOWN-001 atom using these quantum numbers.`
